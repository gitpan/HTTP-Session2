    - Revert HMAC strategy...
      It breaks our code...

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]
    - I changed HMAC strategy on ServerSide mode.
      Previous version uses
      
        hmac_hex(data: $session_id, key: $secret)

      New version is:

        hmac_hex(data: $secret, key: $session)

      This version is even secure. But, it's not a critical issue.

      I think this change won't break your code.

    - use Cookie::Baker for generating cookie string for Plack response object.
      Because the document says HTTP::Session supports Cookie::Baker's expiration format like "-1d".
      But it's not supported in previous version!!
